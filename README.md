# React-Redux Todo-App

In this project, I made a Collaborative Todo-App using [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/). In this App, you can assign the Todos for the other person. The Assignee can mark the respected Todo as Done, can edit and delete them also. There would be two parts, one is Projects, where all Projects would be shown, in which the user lie, and the second one is Todos-part, where user can have a look over all the Todos for a particular project. All the Todos are currently storing in the Redux-State, called Store.

## Requirement and Execution
1. First and foremost, open your terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/yogendra3236/React-Redux-Todo-App.git` to clone this repository. <br>
2. Install the necessary dependencies to your app by running `npm install` on the terminal. <br>
3. Launch the development build of the app, by running `npm start` on the terminal. <br>
4. Visit http://localhost:3000 to use the app.
5. Start the Backend server as well. Go to [this repo](https://github.com/yogendra3236/Collaborative-Todo-Backend), to clone it, and after navigating the directory, type `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. <br>
6. Now, you can start your Backend server, by typing `nodemon server.js` or `node server.js`. 

Happy Coding :)
